# Ungoogle yourself or how to build your own digital (customer data) analytics platform with Tealium and Microsoft Azure

## Introduction
This repository includes everything necessary for running a "Ungoogle yourself or how to build your own digital (customer data) analytics platform with Tealium and Microsoft Azure" workshop on connecting Tealium Event Stream to Azure Event Hub, Stream Analytics and PowerBI, as well as using Databricks to analyze event-based digital behavior data. It was firstly presented on People That Count conference in Warsaw in 2019 and was mostly aimed at people with some digital analytics experience, but if you'd like feel free to follow the guide (**hands-on-guide.pdf**) yourself.

## Prerequisites
To be able to follow all the steps mentioned in the guide you'll need:
